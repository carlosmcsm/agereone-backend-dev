- All /api/agent endpoints are for AI chat services.
- /api/health is a simple healthcheck endpoint.

# ðŸš€ AgereOne SaaS â€“ Endpoint Workflows and Functional Description (2025, Updated)
1. User Registration (/api/auth/register)
- Fields: email, password, first name, last name, username.
- Validations:
    Email: unique, valid format
    Password: strong (â‰¥8 chars, uppercase/lowercase/digit/special)
    Username: unique, â‰¥8 chars, must contain at least one digit
- Initial Plan: Always registered as free
- Domain assignment:
    free â†’ <hash>.agereone.com
    User can upgrade plan in dashboard to get username.agereone.com
- Supabase: Handles Auth, confirmation email sent

2. User Login (/api/auth/login)
- Flow: Email/password â†’ JWT issued
- Validations: Email must be verified

3. Upload Career Profile (/api/profile/upload-file)
- Requires Auth: Yes
- File Types: PDF, TXT, MD
- Chunking:
    Default: System uses standard chunk size (e.g., 400 chars, 20 overlap).
    Advanced: Allow users (optionally, in dashboard) to set custom chunk size/overlap.
        Note: Changing chunk settings requires re-uploading the profile file, and system warns users that embeddings will be regenerated.
- Flow:
    1. Validate file type/size
    2. Extract text from file
    3. If user has no OpenAI key, return error ("Please set your OpenAI key")
    4. Mark all previous profiles as inactive for this user
    5. Remove all vectors from Qdrant for this user
    6. Insert new row in profiles (filename, vector_count=0, model, is_active=True, chunk config used)
    7. Chunk text (with userâ€™s config or default)
    8. Generate embeddings (one per chunk)
    9. Store vectors in Qdrant, update vector count in profiles row
- History/Uploads:
    The dashboard lists metadata of all past uploads (filename, date, model, vector count), but does not store the file itself or allow rollback. Only the latest upload is active; past uploads are reference-only.
- Dashboard:
    Show uploads history for audit.
    Clarify: Only the last uploaded file is active. Past uploads are for records; to re-activate, re-upload the file.

4. Save/Update OpenAI API Key (/api/auth/update-key)
- Requires Auth: Yes
- Flow:
    1. User enters/pastes OpenAI API key and selects model from dropdown
    2. Backend validates and stores in openai_keys (1 row per user)
    3. Model dropdown shows only supported/compliant models

5. Fetch User Profile Settings (/api/auth/profile-settings)
- Requires Auth: Yes
- Returns:
    List of uploaded files (filename, date, is_active)
    OpenAI key (masked) and model
    Subdomain (and status: free/paid)
    Plan, queries remaining (if free)
- Rollback:
    Not possible unless file is re-uploaded. Dashboard clearly explains that only the last upload is active.
- System Prompt:
    User can update their AI system prompt, saved in profile or settings.

6. AI Chat Endpoint (/api/agent/chat)
- Types:
    Dashboard: Authenticated user, full access (within limits)
    Public subdomain: No auth, if is_published=True
- Flow:
    1. Identify user (from JWT or subdomain)
    2. Retrieve vectors for active profile
    3. Query OpenAI with user key/model and context, using the userâ€™s system prompt
    4. Rate limit: 
        Free: X queries/day, Y seconds between requests
        Paid: higher/faster limits

7. AI Chat Streaming Endpoint (/api/agent/chat/stream)
- Same as above, but streams OpenAI reply

8. Delete Profile (/api/profile/delete)
- Requires Auth: Yes
- Flow:
    1. Mark all profiles for user as is_active=False
    2. Remove vectors from Qdrant
    3. Log this for analytics

9. Forgot Password (/api/auth/forgot-password)
- Only for users not logged in.
- Triggers Supabase reset email.

10. Reset Password (/api/auth/reset-password)
- User completes reset using token from email.

11. Public Subdomain/AI Profile Page
- Free: <hash>.agereone.com (unique per user, not vanity)
- Paid: username.agereone.com
- Upgrade/downgrade:
    On upgrade, update DNS/Cloudflare and mark new subdomain as active
    On downgrade, revert to hash subdomain
- Only visible if is_published=True
- SEO: Metadata set dynamically per user/profile

12. Plan Management, Stripe, Analytics
- Endpoints:
    /api/plan/subscribe â€” Starts a Stripe subscription session
    /api/plan/webhook â€” Stripe webhook for payments, renewals, cancel, upgrade/downgrade
    /api/plan/status â€” Userâ€™s current plan, expiry, invoice links
    /api/analytics/usage â€” Return API/chat usage, queries, remaining quota
